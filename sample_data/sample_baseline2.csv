196,196,Normal,1,hey steve  the reason why is because this employee has two employee ids.  meaning they uploaded their data with an employee  danielle stephens  that has two employee ids.  this can occur if it was a rehire but basically if there gp has two employee ids that is telling us there are two different employees even though both employees has the same last name and ssn.  here are the employee ids   stedapq and  for stephens mcgsh and  for mcgraw.  the stedapq and mcgsh seem to just have a few paystubs attached to them from .  see if the client just wants to change their last name or ssn on those emp ids in their paystub workspace  if so that will fix their error.  regardless let the client know what happen,0,1,0,0
197,197,Normal,1,i tried to change the employee id on the paystub workspace to rectify the issue  it was unsucessful.  please see this screenshot in the directory  errorchangingemployeeid.bmp  also   i think a senior tech should give her a call.  she has had some serious issues because of ppr being installed and it s causeing all kinds of conflicts with her data.  she s upset that she apparently didn t have the option to only upload her ws during the onramp and only had the option to do both using ppr.  also  she still has  data on her site which needs to be removed.  i guess  data was uploaded as test during the onramp  but it didn t auto delete as it aught to have.  i ve filed a separate ticket about that.  maybe when those workspaces get removed  we ll be able to correct this problem and allow her employees to log in.,0,1,0,0

199,199,Normal,1,i spoke with christine  she was noticably concerned.  what happened is the  workspace for paystubs caused employees issues to error when they login.  the  workspaces had the employee ids with a handful of  paystubs  for instance emp id  stedapq where that employee id has the same login credentials as emp id     she has a large amount of employees  and in addition she tried to change the employee id and that errored on her per screenshot in working directory.    clint  what are some options we can tell the client   is it possible we can set it up where if an employee logins  they login seeing their latest information   i.e.  ws instead of  paystubs  she also just suggested to take of the  paystub if its easier.,0,1,0,0

252,252,Normal,1,if i had to take a stab  sounds like there is one human employee that has two employee ids in their gp.  gp separates employees by employee id  therefore it tells dmf.com that these are two different employee ids.  sounds like this person can not login because of this  their login is ssn and last name .  take nasa for example  when you worked there you had your last name and ssn.  however when you changed companies but they used the same gp database  they gave everyone new employee ids.  so you had when you login with your last name and ssn  dmf says    hey there are two of these employees  i am not letting either in   .  we set that up that way to prevent accidents of employees seeing another employee   s w.  it is not rare this occurs  but this is an issue because they are basically using gp in a way you are not supposed to.  of course  client doesn   t need to know that.  if this is for ws  they can delete the w.  if not i recommend using employee sign in kb.  it will tell you what you need and you can eventually escalate it somewhere to address their issue.  i hope this helps.  please let me know if you have questions.  kevin chernitsky clientswsupport    ext.     p think green. please don   t print this message unless it   s really necessary. thank you.    from  clientswsupport  sent  monday  january      pm to  kevin chernitsky subject  fw  nathan miller  cindy ketteman has got a question that i don   t know the answer to.  here   s our conversation so far.  do you know the answer,0,1,0,0

442,442,Normal,1,ok  it seem that the issue is due to a flexable spending account  deduction  which is also showing up as a sep deposit. below are the details for ee abe s check number dd dated  . there are  direct deposit amounts.  matches the net wages  and then there is a nd dd in the amount of the deduction  which then makes the total dd .. since that doesnt match the net wages  dmf doesnt list the dd info.       .      .,0,1,0,0
443,443,Normal,1,sheldon  i need your assistance on this one. i spoke with sandra and asked her why they have a deduction as a direct deposit. she stated that this was set up in this way for taxation purposes  since the  flexable spending account deduction is tax free . i dont entirely understand the  why  of this  but need to know if there is a way we can work around this situation  in order to display the dd info. must the dd info match the net wages in order to be displayed,0,1,0,0
444,444,Normal,1,the bottom line here is that we can be stupid or we can be smart.  if we re going to write smart software  which i d like us to do   then we should be displaynig direct deposits if  . the sum of the direct deposits match the net wages  or  . the sum of the direct deposits match the net wages   the tax free benefits  when you actually look at the data  it s obvious we should be including them both.  one of the direct deposits was for the net wage amount  the other was for their hsa benefit.  it s going to be difficult to translate that into sql and even more difficult since we don t have the upr lines to look at  but that s the  right  answer.,0,1,0,0
